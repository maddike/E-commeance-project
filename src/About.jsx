      <p className='about-text'>
        Our journey began with a simple idea — to bring authentic Rayalaseema
        flavors to everyone who loves rich and traditional food. What started as a
        small kitchen serving family recipes has now grown into a place where
        passion meets taste.
      </p>

      <p className='about-text'>
        From spicy curries to fresh vegetarian dishes, every recipe we serve is
        crafted with love and care. We believe in offering food that feels homely,
        flavorful, and unforgettable.
      </p>

      <p className='about-text'>
        Thank you for supporting us and being part of our food journey!
